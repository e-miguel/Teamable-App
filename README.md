### 🚀 Project Overview

Teamable App is a simple full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-world software project.
It demonstrates how frontend, backend, and database components interact in a cloud-based environment.

This project was built step-by-step throughout the IT Beginners Course:

- Planned with Jira (Agile/Scrum)
- Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VueJS, and NodeJS
- Tested with Jest
- Deployed on a Linux Cloud Server

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how the software development lifecycle (SDLC) works.
- Learn how to plan, code, test, and deploy an app.
- Gain hands-on experience with frontend, backend, and cloud deployment.
- Practice version control using Git and GitHub.
